MediLink is an innovative Android application designed to reduce the need for recurring physical visits to clinics or doctors by enabling seamless digital communication between healthcare providers and patients. The app allows doctors to send prescriptions and medical reports directly to their patients, while patients can provide health updates and feedback without the need for an in-person visit. M¬ediLink also offers additional features, such as appointment scheduling, where doctors can set appointments based on prolonged inactivity or health status updates or unusual effects or no effect of prescribed medicine. A built-in calendar feature enables doctors to share their availability, allowing patients to easily request appointments, making healthcare management more efficient and convenient
