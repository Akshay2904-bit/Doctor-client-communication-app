# Doctor-client-communication-app

MediLink is a modern solution developed to enhance the efficiency of doctor
patient communication by leveraging mobile technology. Traditionally, patients have 
been required to visit their doctor frequently, even for minor updates or the absence of 
new developments in their health. This process often leads to unnecessary travel, waiting 
times, and interruptions to both the patient's and doctor's schedules. Moreover, doctors 
must manually manage appointments, health records, and availability, which can be time
consuming and inefficient. 
MediLink seeks to revolutionize this experience by providing a streamlined, digital 
alternative. Built in Java with Firebase as the backend database server, the app integrates 
a chat box where doctors can send medical reports and prescriptions in PDF format 
directly to their patients. These documents can be downloaded, opened, and printed if 
necessary, providing convenience and easy access to vital information. Patients can 
update their health status through text messages, allowing continuous feedback without 
the need for a physical visit. 
In addition, the app offers a calendar feature where doctors can set their 
availability, allowing patients to view open slots and request appointments without the 
hassle of phone calls or visits. Doctors can also set appointments automatically if they 
detect no updates from a patient for an extended period. 
By digitizing these interactions, MediLink introduces a time-saving and more 
beneficial approach to healthcare management, reducing the need for in-person visits, 
optimizing schedules, and ensuring efficient communication between doctors and 
patients. This digital transformation promises to enhance the overall healthcare 
experience for both parties.
